					<p>I created this website to showcase previous work that I have completed; and to practice learning a new skill. This is my first webpage; and it was developed entirely with html and CSS. All work and experiences are 100% by me, unless stated otherwise. You may view my resume/CV, portfolio of work, and various projects which are categorized by: academia, internships, and personal.</p>

                                I am interested in the engineering sciences; but I love to learn new subject areas. Currently I am a techie as an <a href="https://act.house/">ACT House</a> fellow,  a 1 year residential incubator for students at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University (FAMU). My cohort, the third in its class is composed of six students - including myself. Three of the fellows: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/xavier-miranda-95a270162/">Xavier Miranda</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/imani-hayden-287820122/">Imani Hayden</a>, and myself have begun the composition of a startup. I also have other ventures in the works.  I love to travel. My first time riding a plane, and leaving the Florida-Georgia area, was going to my NASA internship in DC. Since then I have visited eight states, and traveled to Paris, and Cannes, France.

                            Three years after adopting the vegan lifestyle, I am healthier and living cleaner. The two most common beverages I consume are water and tea. Aside from academics, my activities of interests are hanging with friends who constantly challenge you, playing sports - as I am highly competitive, cooking, and teaching/tutoring others. The knowledge I have obtained comes from a vast variety of information such as: Quora Digest, Youtube, Google, classrooms and books. My mother (pictured above) is my inspiration, as she has continuously made the best out of less than optimal circumstances.
