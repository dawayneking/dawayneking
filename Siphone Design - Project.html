                <h1>Siphon Consumer Design Project</h1>
                
                <h3><font color="black">Recognizing the need</font></h3>
  <p>           The client, Keith Larson, has asked us to create a siphon for his aquariums. There are three different sizes, (30, 55, and 75 gallons); and product should work better than clients three currently owned. 
Two problems with currently owned siphons are water spillage and difficulty cleaning. 
                        </p>
                <h3><font color="black">Defining the problem</font></h3>
<p>             <b>Goal:</b>  Design an improved siphon hose that won’t spill water or get water in the consumer’s mouth.
    <br>
<b>Objectives:</b>
    <br>
Functional without problems
    <br>
Size appropriate and easy to use
    <br>
Used for three tanks of various sizes
    <br>
Will not leak 
    <br>
Constraints: 
    <br>
Within budget (Less than $30)
    <br>
Needs to function for 30, 55, and 75 gallon fish tanks
